# Bobonne's Challenge

## Intro
Bobonne's challenge is a cardgame that resembles Solitaire but with
a few notable differences.  Firstly the game consists of 8 play stacks
and 4 spare stacks.  The goal of the game is to sort all available cards 
into only 4 remaining card stacks, where each stack must contain the cards 
King-to-Ace of 1 particular suit.  Cards can only be placed on top of
other cards when they possess the correct descending rank as well as have
the same suit and are all facing up.
